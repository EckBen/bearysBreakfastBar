# Beary's Breakfast Bar
## Mock Restaurant Page
### By: Ben Eck

The purpose of this project was to create a fake restaurant web page that utilized Javascript to generate all of the page content. With the exception of the header and footer information, this page accomplishes that. It is also designed to be highly modular and to utilize as little global code as possible in the Javascript.
